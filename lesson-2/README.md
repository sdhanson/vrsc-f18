### Navmeshes
Introduction:
* Navmeshes are great for specifying where your AI can walk around in your game/experience. Personally, I used a navmesh to allow people to traverse a virtual city in Germany! The built in functionality is super helpful, and if you have to create a mesh that enables navigation in your game think of a *navmesh*!
