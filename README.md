# VRSC Incubator Fall 2018: VR Dev Guide

This is the VRSC Incubator Fall 2018 repository. This is your home base, and here you'll find resources to help you learn Unity, Game Development practices, and any additional XR dev skills your teams need! There is a folder for each worksop. Within each folder is a README.md with a step-by-step guide articulating the goal for the workshop. We will go through each lesson together at VRSC workshops, but you should look back at each guide if you need a refresher while developing.

### Lesson Topics
  * Lesson 1: Unity + GitHub
  
### Additional Resources

### Final Note
Each lesson contains a README.md reiterating the lessons we learn in each workshop. Use the README.md to follow along during the lesson and reinforce the lessons at later times. If we manipulate Unity throughout the lesson, completed code will be included in the folder.

Remember, this is your ultimate resource for XR development.
